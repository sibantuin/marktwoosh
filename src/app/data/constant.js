We then refurbished the brand and colors in a way that made sense for a multicultural user level. Once these were in place we started designing the website with a strong focus on product presentation, company ethos, principles and story. Our biggest challenge was to create a custom Wordpress theme with an intuitive CMS so that Mondona could easily update their website’s content after finalization of the project.​`

This gives us the freedom to design exactly the websites we want to put out into the web. By custom coding the themes ourselves we get significant more control over the outcome and our websites perform better on Google ranking, loading speeds, and safety. For Mondona we used WooCommerce to build everything on, of course with a lot of customization on top. After the website was finished and all the shipping providers and dynamic pricing and payment systems through Stripe, based on the country of visit were in place, our new Mondona website was ready to launch.​`
